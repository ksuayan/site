The highway offers views of Pacific Ocean, making it one of the most scenic drives in the country, and runs through the heart of many coastal cities. However, from Florence to Bandon, the highway is slightly inland because of the vast Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe highway is connected to Interstate 5 by many highways that run along rivers, such as the Umpqua (Highway 38). Typically it takes one to two hours to reach I-5 from the coast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe only commercial airport on the coast lies in North Bend. The airport is serviced with daily flights to and from Portland International Airport via Horizon Air. You can drive from the airport in Portland to the coast via Highway 26 and Highway 6 in about couple hours. Flying into Portland is usually more economical than flying into North Bend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eGet Around\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA car is the best way to get around the Oregon Coast. U.S. Highway 101 often serves as the main drag in most of the coastal cities. Many businesses have built along 101 in an effort to attract tourists passing by. During the summer season, make sure you are not in a big hurry. It was recently named No. 1 for tourist congestion, beating out the popular Cape Cod.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreyhound no longer serves the coast, but many towns are serviced by local bus lines such as Porter Stage Coach.\u003c/p\u003e"}
